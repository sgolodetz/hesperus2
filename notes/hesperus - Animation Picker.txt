***

- Movement type is cleared at the beginning of each frame and partly determined by what commands are executed.
  - But "jump" is determined by whether the player's in the air or not.
- Pose type can be extracted from the bounds component (at present).
- Status type can be extracted from the health component.
- Modifier can be extracted from the inventory component.
