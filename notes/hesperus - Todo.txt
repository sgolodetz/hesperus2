Easy
----

* Walk/run etc. - sort out where the various different entity speeds are coming from (I'd suggest the definitions file).
* Add verbose modes for tools (particularly hvis, where it's helpful to see current progress).
* Sort out the mess of functions in FieldIO.
* Ensure the object ID of the viewer is loaded in from the objects file, rather than hard-coded.
* Fix the untidy initialisation in CmpInventory.
* Rename the various yokes.
  - MinimusScriptYoke -> BipedScriptedYoke, UserBipedYoke -> BipedUserYoke, MinimusGotoPositionYoke -> BipedGotoPositionYoke.

* Implement some AI yokes (it probably makes sense to have composite yokes so that we can switch between different yokes for different behaviours - could we have yoke trees corresponding to goal trees?).
* View frustum culling.
* Move the item activation code into an object command.
* Sort out how crouching can be properly determined in CmpBipedAnimChooser::choose_animation().

Hard

* Update MapEditor to allow placement of entities, etc. Some sort of scripted paths should be added as well.
* Implement AI scripting.
* Implement collision handling between dynamic objects.
* Reimplement hlight to allow dynamic lighting.
* Implement weapons and projectiles.
* Refactor the movement functionality from MoveFunctions into the relevant movement components.
  - DirectMovement should be parameterised on a collision response "strategy", e.g. sliding, bouncing, sticking, exploding
  - MeshMovement should be derived from DirectMovement, and use a sliding collision response strategy
  - Refactor the physics functionality into the movement components.
* Sort out the bounds functionality.
